<a name="usage"></a>
# Basic Usage 


## Checking the status of your goals
- launch beeAlfred by typing `!q` or using an optional hotkey
- beeAlfred will return goals and their status/deadline

### Entering a new datapoint
- search a goal by typing `!q` followed by a goal name or matching string
- select your goal by pressing `return`. 
	- `option-return (‚å•‚èé)` will open the goal in Beeminder
- enter your value plus an optional comment after space

<a name="known-issues"></a>
# Known issues 


- beeAlfred is using the local timezone to compute derail time. It might not correspond to the real derail time if a different timezone is set on [beeminder.com](beeminder.com)
- nothing else for now, but I have only tested a few use cases, let me know if you see anything!
